# Task:
# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
# (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number.
# For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)


#This is my solution. I created a forever loop wherein you can input an integer and get a list of its factors/divisors.

    divisors = [pdivisor for pdivisor in list(range(1, number+1)) if number%pdivisor == 0]
